# Postop-TodoList

Postop is a GoLang-Fiber backend and TypeScript-Next.js frontend todo list app coding challenge.

# Requirements

If you want to take it, please feel free to do so. Here are its requirements:

##### For Backend:

- GoLang
- Fiber (I recommend this one) / regular golang http

##### For Frontend:

- TypeScript, Next.js
- Tailwind.css / styled-components (both are optional)

Do not create your own CSS or SCSS files. Logic matters.
Make sure you have the `backend` and `frontend` folders in the same repository.
