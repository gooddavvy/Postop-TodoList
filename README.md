# Postop-TodoList

Postop is a GoLang-Fiber backend and TypeScript-Next.js frontend todo list app coding challenge. **Anyone** can understand its coding strucuture--it was made to easily be followed along with and maybe improved by!

To run it

# Requirements

If you want to take it, please feel free to do so. Here are its requirements:

##### For Backend:

- GoLang
- Fiber (I recommend this one) / regular golang http

##### For Frontend:

- TypeScript, Next.js
- Tailwind.css / styled-components (both are optional)

Do not create your own CSS or SCSS files. Logic matters.
Make sure you have the `backend` and `frontend` folders in the same repository.

If you have issues with setting up your backend, and you are using VS Code, I think it know what you mean, because I've encountered it before--so LMK in the Issues section of this repository. Thanks for reading the requirements!

# Extra Info

Remember, this challenge will not pay you money or reward you anything except for congratulations. It is only necessary to challenge yourself.

Once you've finished, lmk in the issues.
